RUNNING ANSIBLE PLAYBOOK FROM JENKINS
Now that you have a broad overview of a typical Jenkins pipeline. Let us get the actual Ansible deployment to work by:

### Installing Ansible on Jenkins
```sudo apt install ansible```

### Installing Ansible plugin in Jenkins UI
To check for where ansible has been installed
```which ansible```

Creating Jenkinsfile from scratch. (Delete all you currently have in there and start all over to get Ansible to run successfully)
